# AR for WeMap

This is an AR web app that helps Wellesley students/affiliates find ideal workplaces and connect with each other.

## How to use this web app

1. Open your phone browser and go to https://panoramic-broad-muscle.glitch.me 
2. Scan the AR marker besides each building module on WeMap
3. Manipulate the virtual poster (e.g. zoom in/out) using gestures
4. Click on the live update button to check our website

_Sometimes it gets glitchy and nothing appears when you tap on the objects. I recommend refreshing the page, restarting the app, using a different browser, or restarting your phone!_
